HighNoon
========

A simple XNA 4 game for two gunslingers with a nice CRT style pixel shader.
When instructed to draw whichever player presses their key the quickest wins.
Don't draw before high noon otherwise your gun will jam leaving you vulnerable...

Build Instructions
------------------

This is a visual studio 2012 project, that requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23714">XNA 4.0 Studio</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=6812">DirectX SDK</a>
The project should 'just build' if you meet these requirements.

Visual Studio 2012 will complain that XNA is not supported, however you can ignore this warning.
